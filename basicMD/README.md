# This is a tutorial for running Lennard-Jones gas simulations

## 1. Running script
   md_euler.py simulates using Euler integration.
   md_velocityverlet.py simulates using velocity Verlet integration.

   **Usage:** Simulation parameters can be modified by following in-file documentation and simulation is run by calling the "run" function with necessary arguments. 

   **Note**: Script is based on Python 3 and numpy library is necessary.
