# This is a tutorial for running Lennard-Jones gas simulations

## 1. Running script
   [LJmd_euler.py] simulates Lennard-Jones gas particles using Euler integration

   [LJmd_velocityverlet.py] simulates Lennard-Jones gas particles using velocity Verlet integration

   [IDEALmd_euler.py] simulates ideal gas particles using Euler integration

   **Usage:** Simulation parameters can be modified by following in-file documentation and simulation is run by calling the "run" function with necessary arguments. 

   **Note**: Script is based on Python 3 and numpy library is necessary.
