# /runsamples/

## This is a collection of simulation output files generated by this MD engine
These simulations were run as parts of various tests conducted on or using this python MD engine. For a full report on how this data was was used, see [README.md](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/blob/main/learnhere/README.md) in [learnhere](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/tree/main/learnhere).

## File Indexing:
The simulation files in [integrator_stability](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/tree/main/runsamples/integrator_stability) were generated as part of a set of simulations to test the stability of Euler and velocity Verlet integration algorithms at various timesteps. For information on specifc simulation parameters for each file, see [README.md](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/blob/main/runsamples/integrator_stability/README.md) in [integrator_stability](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/tree/main/runsamples/integrator_stability).

The simulation files in [pressure_temperature](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/tree/main/runsamples/pressure_temperature) were generated as part of a set of simulations to test the temperature-pressure relationship of systems simulated with a Berendsen thermostat in comparison to ideal gas. For information on specific simulation parameters for each file, see [README.md](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/blob/main/runsamples/pressure_temperature/README.md) in [pressure_temperature](https://github.com/nAmnesiac/py_basicMD/tree/main/runsamples/pressure_temperature).
